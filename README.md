Ari Björn Ólafsson is a software developer from Reykjavik, Iceland with years of versatile experience in different sectors ranging from banking, aviation, machine learning, travel tech, business operations, car parking, fisheries logistics, payments, ticket systems, government backed research, information security, cartography, multimedia, web technologies and more.  

Often intrigued by hackathons or startup accelerators, I have, with consistent success, competed in software, hacking or business related events throughout the years, teamed up with friends, family and colleagues. 

I am genuinely passionate about technology. I do what I love, and I love what I do. Even with unlimited money and resources, I would continue my career in IT, startups, and various business domains, always working hard to help my employers, friends, partners, and clients achieve their business goals.

### **Disclaimer**: 

Any cultural claims are anecdotal and not based on any real evidence. These are my observations and my opinions. 

This is the public / personal GitHub account of Ari Björn Ólafsson with programming jokes, job entrance tasks, random ideas and personal whimsical projects throughout the years. It does not reflect my actual volume of activity, because I have often through my career been politely asked to use a company managed github account rather than my own. 

The culture in Iceland around GitHub accounts is changing, and more often, people are starting to bring in their own GitHub accounts to a job; and are onboarded via Organization Access to have the access revoked when changing jobs. This would result in a more solid contribution history chart - versus - when using a disposable account, for every single job. 

This summary does not breach any NDAs. The information provided is either sourced from public websites linked to each claim or covered by termination agreements that explicitly void any liability from previously agreed NDA clauses in the employment contract or any other related clauses.

I will refer to myself in **third person** following this statement.
